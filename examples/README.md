# ETISS Application Examples

The projects in this folder cannot be used directly. Once ETISS is build
and installed, a copy of these projects is available in the install
directory:`<build_dir>/installed/examples`

They can be compiled and run simulation from there.

  > NOTE: bare\_etiss\_processor contains actual ETISS application example
  while SW folder accommodates target software for simulation.

## Getting Started
Refer to the `README` located in the parent folder to build and install
ETISS. For each application project, refer to `README`s in project folders
respectively.

In the MakeFile for each example, change `TOOLBIN` to the address of gcc toolchain.
